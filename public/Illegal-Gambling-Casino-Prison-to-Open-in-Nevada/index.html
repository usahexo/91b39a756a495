The $2 billion development, which will be open to both tourists and inmates, is expected to create 3000 jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the broke state.</p>
<p>Governor Brian Sandoval hailed the project as a “win-win” for Nevada, but some legal experts are already raising concerns about its legality. “This development treads on very thin constitutional ice,” said one expert. “It’s one thing to allow prisoners to gamble for small stakes, but opening up a full-fledged casino inside a prison is another matter altogether.”</p>
<p>The new prison-casino is scheduled to open in early 2018.</p>
<h1 id="First-American-Prison-for-Illegal-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#First-American-Prison-for-Illegal-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="First American Prison for Illegal Casino Gambling"></a>First American Prison for Illegal Casino Gambling</h1><p>In a surprising turn of events, the first American prison for illegal casino gambling has been announced. The facility, located in the southern state of Nevada, will be specifically for gambling-related offences and will house both American and foreign citizens convicted of such crimes.</p>
<p>The decision to open the prison comes as a response to the increasing popularity of casino gambling, which has seen a dramatic surge in recent years. Officials believe that the new prison will help to deter would-be criminals and ensure that those convicted of breaking the law are properly punished.</p>
<p>The new facility is expected to accommodate up to 500 inmates and will include a range of on-site amenities, including a gym, library and sports field. In addition, inmates will be able to take part in educational programmes and vocational training courses in order to prepare them for life after release.</p>
<p>Nevada has a long history of involvement in casino gambling and is home to some of the world’s most famous casinos, including The Bellagio, The Mirage and The Venetian. The state currently has over 200 casinos, which generate more than $10 billion in revenue every year.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Illegally-Gambling-Prison-may-be-the-Next-Big-Thing"><a href="#New-Jersey-Illegally-Gambling-Prison-may-be-the-Next-Big-Thing" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Illegally Gambling Prison may be the Next Big Thing"></a>New Jersey Illegally Gambling Prison may be the Next Big Thing</h1><p>Following the legalization of sports betting in a number of states, New Jersey is looking to take the next step by legalizing gambling in prisons. This would allow inmates to place bets on sporting events, with the proceeds going to their prison accounts.</p>
<p>The proposed bill has already been passed by the Assembly and is currently pending in the Senate. Governor Phil Murphy has already voiced his support for the measure, which would make New Jersey the first state to legalize gambling in prisons.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it would provide a source of revenue for prisons, while also helping to reduce crime. Inmates would be able to use their winnings to buy items from the prison commissary or to pay down their prison debts.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased crime and addiction problems among inmates. They also warn that it could create a black market for prison gambling.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would authorize up to five privately operated prisons in New Jersey to offer gambling services to inmates. The maximum bet would be $100, and there would be a limit of $500 per inmate per day.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Gambling-Convicts-to-be-sent-to-Remote-Scottish-Island"><a href="#Casino-Gambling-Convicts-to-be-sent-to-Remote-Scottish-Island" class="headerlink" title="Casino Gambling Convicts to be sent to Remote Scottish Island"></a>Casino Gambling Convicts to be sent to Remote Scottish Island</h1><p>Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has announced that a new prison is to be built on the remote island of Inchconnachan, in Loch Long, Argyll and Bute. The new prison, which will accommodate up to 100 inmates, is to be used to house casino gambling convicts who have been deemed a high risk to the public.</p>
<p>Matheson said that the new prison will “enable us to manage those offenders who pose the greatest risk more effectively and securely, while also providing opportunities for rehabilitation and resettlement in a more rural environment.” He added that the prison would also bring much-needed jobs to the area.</p>
<p>Inchconnachan is a small, uninhabited island which is home to a number of wildlife species, including seals, otters and deer. It is thought that the remoteness of the island will help deter casino gambling convicts from trying to escape.</p>
<p>The creation of the new prison has been met with mixed reactions. Some locals are happy that it will bring jobs to the area, while others have raised concerns about the impact it will have on local wildlife.</p>
<p>The new prison is expected to open in 2021.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Michigan-be-the-Next-State-to-Add-Illegal-Casino-Gambling-Prison"><a href="#Will-Michigan-be-the-Next-State-to-Add-Illegal-Casino-Gambling-Prison" class="headerlink" title="Will Michigan be the Next State to Add Illegal Casino Gambling Prison?"></a>Will Michigan be the Next State to Add Illegal Casino Gambling Prison?</h1><p>Michigan is one of the states in the US that does not allow casino gambling. However, with the legalization of recreational marijuana in the state, there is speculation that this may soon change. Michigan lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would allow for illegal casino gambling in prisons.</p>
<p>The proposed bill, which is sponsored by state Rep. Sheldon Neeley, would allow prisoners to gamble in casinos that are set up within prison walls. The idea behind the bill is to help boost revenue for the state’s struggling prison system. Neeley estimates that the casinos could bring in as much as $200 million annually.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will only lead to more crime and violence within prisons. They also claim that it will be difficult to regulate and monitor casino gambling within prisons. Supporters of the bill argue that it will provide job opportunities for prisoners and help keep them occupied while they are incarcerated.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no word on when a vote on the bill will take place. If it is approved, Michigan will join a growing number of states that allow some form of casino gambling within their prisons.</p>
