This guide will show you how to set up a gambling bot and give you some of the most common commands.</p>
<p>To get started, you’ll need a Discord server and a gambling bot. There are a number of different gambling bots available, so you can choose the one that best suits your needs. Once you have your bot, add it to your Discord server.</p>
<p>The next step is to configure the bot. Each bot has different settings, so you’ll need to refer to the bot’s documentation to configure it. Generally, you’ll need to provide the bot with your Discord server ID and the IDs of the channels where you want the bot to gamble.</p>
<p>Now that the bot is configured, let’s take a look at some of the most common commands.</p>
<p>!g start - Starts a game of chance.</p>
<p>!g roll - Rolls a dice and tells you the result.</p>
<p>!g bet <amount> - Places a bet on the next game. The minimum bet is 1 coin.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Set-Up-Gambling-Bot-Commands-for-Your-Discord-Server"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-Gambling-Bot-Commands-for-Your-Discord-Server" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up Gambling Bot Commands for Your Discord Server"></a>How to Set Up Gambling Bot Commands for Your Discord Server</h1><p><em>This guide is meant for experienced bot users who are familiar with the Discord API. If you’re not comfortable setting up a bot or don’t know what that is, please search for a more beginner-friendly guide before continuing.</em></p>
<p>Creating gambling commands for your Discord server can be an enjoyable way to add some extra excitement for your users. By setting up a few simple commands, your server can become a hub for gambling enthusiasts of all levels of experience. In this guide, we’ll show you how to set up betting and dice commands using the Discord Bot SDK.</p>
<p>First, we’ll need to create a new Discord app. Navigate to the apps page on the Discord website and click “Create New App.” You’ll be asked to provide a name and description for your app. For the purposes of this guide, we’ll name our app “Gambling Bot.”</p>
<p>Once you’ve created your app, you’ll be taken to its settings page. On this page, you’ll find your App ID and App Secret. Make note of these as you’ll need them later.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll need to install the Discord Bot SDK. You can do this by following instructions found on the Bot SDK website. It’s important that you follow the instructions exactly - particularly when it comes to installing additional dependencies such as NodeJS and MongoDB.</p>
<p>With the Bot SDK installed, it’s time to start creating our bot commands. Let’s start by creating a command that allows users to bet on whether or not a specific number will be rolled on a die. We’ll call this command “bet.” The command will take two arguments: the first is the amount of money that the user wants to bet, and the second is the number they want to bet on. So for example, if someone wanted to bet $10 on number 4 being rolled, they would type “bet 10 4” into chat.</p>
<p>To create this command, we’ll first need to create a new File in our project folder called “commands.” This file will contain all of our bot’s commands. Inside this file, we’ll create a new function called “bet.” This function will take two arguments: amount and number . It will also return a message which will be sent back to the user when they run the command. So our final function looks like this:</p>
<p>bet(amount: number, number: number) {</p>
<pre><code>// calculate how much money was wagered

let totalWager = amount * (number - 1)
</code></pre>
<p>   &#x2F;&#x2F; send back message indicating user won or lost their wager</p>
<p>   return <code>$&#123;totalWager&#125; was wagered on $&#123;number&#125;. The result was $&#123;dieResult&#125;</code></p>
<p>}</p>
<p>As you can see, we’ve simply used basic math operations here to calculate how much money was wagered and then send back a message indicating whether or not the player won or lost their wager. Now let’s test out our command in chat! Try typing “bet 10 4” into any chat channel and hit enter- you should see something like “10 was wagered on 4. The result was 3” echoed back to you indicating that you lost your wager.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to creating our dice roll command. We’ll call this command “roll.” The roll command will take one argument- which is the number of sides on the die being rolled. So for example, if someone wanted to roll a 6-sided die, they would type “roll 6” into chat.</p>
<p> Similar to our Bet command, we’re going to need another function in our file called “roll.” This function will take one argument- side . It will also return a message which will be sent back to the user when they run the command. Our final function looks like this:</p>
<p>roll(side: number) {</p>
<p>   &#x2F;&#x2F; calculate how many possible outcomes there are for given die roll</p>
<p>   let possibleOutcomes &#x3D; Math .ceil(side * (side + 1))</p>
<p> &#x2F;&#x2F; return message indicating user won or lost their roll</p>
<p>   return <code>$&#123;possibleOutcomes&#125; possible outcomes for $&#123;side&#125;. The result was $&#123;dieResult&#125;</code>; }</p>
<p>Testing out our Roll command is just as easy as testing out our Bet command- try typing “roll 6” into any chat channel and hit enter! You should see something like “6 possible outcomes for 6. The result was 4” echoed back to you indicating that you lost your roll</p>

In this guide, we will go over the basics of setting up and creating a gambling bot for your server, as well as some of the more advanced features that you can include.</p>
<h2 id="Setting-Up-Your-Bot"><a href="#Setting-Up-Your-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up Your Bot"></a>Setting Up Your Bot</h2><p>The first thing that you will need to do is set up your bot. To do this, you will need to create a new Discord server if you do not already have one. If you do not know how to create a Discord server, there are plenty of guides online that can walk you through the process. Once you have created your server, you will need to join it and create a new channel. This channel will be where your bot will reside.</p>
<p>Once you have created your channel, you will need to add a bot to it. To add a bot, you will need to send a message to the @BotFather on Discord. The @BotFather is the bot that is used to create and manage bots on Discord. In order to send him a message, simply type @BotFather into the search bar on Discord and hit enter. When the BotFather pops up, type &#x2F;addbot into the message box and hit enter. This will add the Botfather’s Bot to your Discord server.</p>
<p>Now that your bot is added to your server, you will need to give it some basic information so that it can function properly. To do this, you will need to send the BotFather a message containing the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of your bot</li>
<li>The description of your bot 3) The avatar URL for your bot 4) The permissions for your bot 5) The user ID of the owner of the bot 6) The URL of the website where users can gamble</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have sent this information to the BotFather, he will generate an authorization token for your bot which you will need in order to start coding it. Copy this authorization token and save it somewhere safe as you will need it later on.</p>
<h2 id="Coding-Your-Bot"><a href="#Coding-Your-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Coding Your Bot"></a>Coding Your Bot</h2><p>Now that your bot has been set up and has all of its basic information, it’s time to start coding it! To do this, we recommend using the programming language NodeJS. NodeJS is a programming language that is specifically designed for developing applications using JavaScript. It has become increasingly popular in recent years due in part to its use by major companies such as Google, Netflix, PayPal, and Uber. While NodeJS may not be necessary for developing a gambling bot, it offers several advantages over other languages which we will go over later on in this guide. If you are not familiar with NodeJS or JavaScript in general, we recommend checking out some online tutorials before continuing with this guide.</p>
<p>To get started coding our gambling bot using NodeJS, we first need to require two modules: discord and crypto-js . We can do this by adding these two lines of code at the top of our file:</p>
<p>var discord &#x3D; require(“discord”);<br>var crypto &#x3D; require(“crypto-js”);</p>
<p>Now that we have these two modules required, we can start writing our code! The first thing we want to do is create an object containing our bots’ basic information which we previously sent to the BotFather . We can do this by adding the following lines of code:</p>
<p>var info &#x3D; { “name”: “GamblingBot”, “description”: “A Gambling Bot for Your Discord Server”, “avatarUrl”: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://url/to/avatar/image&quot;">https://url/to/avatar/image&quot;</a>, “permissions”: [“read:user”], “owner”: “@USERID”, “siteUrl”: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://url/to/gambling/site&quot;">https://url/to/gambling/site&quot;</a> }; </p>
<p>Next up, we want to create our main() function which is going off discord events . This function runs every time an event happens on our discord server . For now we’ll just log everything out but later on in this guide we’ll be making use of some more interesting events :  </p>
<p>function main(event) {  console.log(“***** GamblingBot -main()*****”);   console.log(“&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;”);   console.log(event); &#x2F;&#x2F;print out received event }</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at how our gamblingbot should interact with users . Generally speaking , there are three types of user interactions : 1 ) Post messages 2 ) Reply messages 3 ) Create servers</p>
<p>For now , let ‘s just focus on reply messages . In order for our chatbot t o reply t o users ,we first need t o get th e user ‘ s message id (which i s unique t o each message ) . W e c an d o thi s wit hthe help o f th e discor d modul e w hich giv es us access t o</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Use-Casino-Games-in-Your-Discord-Server-with-Moobot"><a href="#How-to-Use-Casino-Games-in-Your-Discord-Server-with-Moobot" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Casino Games in Your Discord Server with Moobot"></a>How to Use Casino Games in Your Discord Server with Moobot</h1><p>One of the great things about Discord is the ability to use bots to enhance your server. There are a variety of bots that can be used for different purposes, but one of the most popular bots for gaming is Moobot.</p>
<p>Moobot can be used to add casino games to your Discord server. This allows users on your server to enjoy some fun and exciting games while they chat with each other. In addition, casino games can be used to generate rewards for your server members.</p>
<p>Here’s how to set up casino games in your Discord server using Moobot:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First, you’ll need to install Moobot on your Discord server. You can find instructions on how to do this on the Moobot website.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once Moobot is installed, you’ll need to create a new game by typing the following command into the chat: !newgame</p>
</li>
<li><p>This will create a new game in Moobot and give you a link to it. You’ll need to copy this link and paste it into a new text channel in your Discord server.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, you’ll need to configure the settings for your new game by typing the following command into the chat: !config <game name></p>
</li>
<li><p>This will open a configuration window for your game where you can set various options, such as the number of players, the type of game, and the amount of money that can be won or lost.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now it’s time to start playing! To join the game, type !join <game name> into the chat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-to-Add-Fun-Gambling-Games-to-Your-Discord-Server-with-Moobot"><a href="#How-to-Add-Fun-Gambling-Games-to-Your-Discord-Server-with-Moobot" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Fun Gambling Games to Your Discord Server with Moobot"></a>How to Add Fun Gambling Games to Your Discord Server with Moobot</h1><p>Adding a Moobot to your Discord server provides a variety of features that can add some extra fun and excitement to your gaming sessions. One great way to use Moobot is by adding gambling games!</p>
<p>There are a few different types of gambling games that you can add to your server. The first type is called a “betting game”. In a betting game, players place bets on the outcome of an event. The most common type of betting game is a race, where players bet on which character or team will be the first to reach the finish line. Other popular betting games include guessing the outcome of a coin flip or playing rock, paper, scissors.</p>
<p>The second type of gambling game is called a “lottery”. In a lottery, players purchase tickets for a chance to win a prize. The prize can be anything from in-game items or currencies to real-world prizes like gift cards or cash. Lotteries can be played with any number of participants, but it’s best if there are at least 10 players so that there is a decent chance of winning something.</p>
<p>Adding gambling games to your Discord server is easy with Moobot. All you need to do is configure Moobot to send messages about the games whenever they start and end. To get started, open up the Moobot Configuration window by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left corner of Moobot’s main window:</p>
<p>Next, click on the “Gambling Games” tab:</p>
<p>You will then see a list of all the gambling games that Moobot supports. To enable a game, simply check the box next to its name:</p>
<p>Once you have enabled one or more games, click on the “OK” button at the bottom of the window to save your changes:</p>
<p>Now that Moobot is configured to run gambling games, it’s time to start playing! To join in on a game, simply type !gamedName in chat where gamedName is the name of the game you want to play. For example, if you want to join in on a race, type !race into chat and you will be taken to the race lobby. From there, just follow the instructions displayed in chat to place your bets and start playing!</p>
