#  Dealers Can Expect to Earn $30,000 on Average

Most dealers can expect to make around $30,000 annually in commissions, according to a recent study. The study, which was conducted by the Automobile Association of America (AAA), found that car dealers earned an average commission of $2,000 for every new car they sold.

The study also found that dealers generally earn more money on new cars than they do on used cars. In fact, the average commission for a new car was nearly twice as much as the average commission for a used car.

There are a few reasons for this disparity. For one, new cars tend to be more expensive than used cars. In addition, dealers typically have less leverage when negotiating the price of a used car than they do when negotiating the price of a new car.

Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. Some dealers may be able to earn more money selling used cars than new cars. And some dealers may be able to earn less than $30,000 per year in commissions.

But in general, this is what most dealers can expect to make. So if you're thinking about becoming a car dealer, it's important to keep this in mind.

#  Casino Dealer Salary: How Much Do They Make?

A casino dealer's salary can vary depending on the casino, the level of experience the dealer has, and the region of the world. However, most dealers earn an hourly wage plus tips.

Deck hands at tribal casinos in the US typically start at around $8 per hour, while those working in riverboat and commercial casinos can expect a starting salary of $10-$12 per hour. 

In Canada, wages for casino dealers start at around C$10 per hour and go up to C$20 or more depending on experience. 

Casino dealers in Europe generally make more than their counterparts in North America. In the UK, for example, entry-level salaries for dealers range from £15,000 to £17,000 (about C$25,000 to $30,000), with experienced dealers making up to £40,000 (approximately C$68,000). 

Casino management typically sets a minimum tip expectation for its dealers. Typically, this falls in the range of $1-$2 per hour played. However, many experienced and high-performing dealers can make far more in tips than their base salary.

#  Dealers Can Expect to Earn Less Than $20,000 a Year

According to a study released by the National Automobile Dealers Association, dealers can expect to earn an annual salary of less than $20,000.

In their report, the NADA found that the median income for a new-car dealer was just $19,744 in 2016. That’s down from $21,783 in 2012.

The study also found that the average dealer’s profit margin on new cars was 2.5%, while the average profit margin on used cars was only 1.8%.

These numbers are likely to have shrunk even further in 2017, as car sales have declined in recent months.

This is troubling news for dealers, who are already struggling to stay afloat in today’s competitive market. Many dealers have been forced to close their doors in recent years, and those that remain are facing an uncertain future.

There are several reasons for this decline in income. First, the internet has made it easier for consumers to buy cars directly from manufacturers or online retailers. This has given consumers more options and made it harder for dealers to make a profit.

Second, there has been a shift in consumer preferences towards SUVs and crossovers, which tend to be more profitable for dealers than smaller cars. As a result, dealers have had to focus more attention on these higher-margin vehicles and less on smaller cars.

Third, the automotive industry is facing significant competition from companies like Tesla and Uber, which are disrupting the market with innovative new products and services. This has put pressure on dealers to compete or risk losing market share.

Fourth, there has been a sharp rise in acquisition costs over the past few years. This has forced dealerships to spend more money on things like advertising and employee training. As a result, they have less money left over to pay themselves a salary.

#  Casino Dealers' Wages Fall in the Middle of the Pack

In a recently released report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced that the wages for casino dealers nationwide have fallen in the middle of the pack when compared to other similar professions.

The report, which comes from data collected in May of 2018, shows that casino dealers make an average wage of $13.78 per hour. This puts them ahead of service industry workers such as food servers and behind retail sales associates.

Despite this ranking, casino dealers fared much better than gaming cage workers and slot technicians, who both earn an average wage below $12 per hour.

When compared to other positions within the gambling industry, casino dealers' wages fall near the middle. Gaming managers earn an average wage of $47.02 per hour while gaming service workers make just $10.88 per hour.

The report also shows that the percentage of casino dealer jobs that are held by women is on the rise. Currently, 47 percent of all casino dealer positions are held by women, up from 44 percent in 2017.

#  Casino Dealer Salaries by State

While casino dealer salaries may vary by state, the average salary is around $25,000. However, depending on the location and the casino, salaries can range anywhere from $18,000 to $40,000.

In Nevada, the average salary is $26,000 while in New Jersey it is $23,000. In California, the average salary is $21,000 and in Missouri it is only $18,000. On the high end of the spectrum is Atlantic City where dealers can earn up to $40,000.

The reason for this discrepancy is likely due to a number of factors including cost of living and competition for casino jobs.
