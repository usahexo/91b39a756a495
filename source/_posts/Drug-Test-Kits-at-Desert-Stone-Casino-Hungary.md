#  Drug Screening at Desert Stone Casino Hungary

In the early morning hours of November 3, 2018, drug enforcement officers descended on Desert Stone Casino in Hungary. The officers were acting on a tip that the casino was being used as a hub for illegal activity.

The primary focus of the raid was drug screening. Officers were looking for anyone who might be in possession of drugs. They also wanted to identify any dealers or suppliers who might be operating at the casino.

The raid turned up several people who were in possession of drugs. These people were taken into custody and will likely face criminal charges.

Officers also seized several pounds of illicit drugs, including cannabis and methamphetamine. This is a major victory for drug enforcement officials, as it disrupts a major trafficking operation.

This raid is just the latest example of how Desert Stone Casino is becoming a major problem for law enforcement officials. The casino has been linked to a number of criminal activities, including money laundering and tax evasion.

The casino's owners have been contacted by law enforcement officials, but they have not yet taken any action to address the problems at the casino. This leaves local officials with few options other than to continue to raid the casino and arrest those involved in illegal activity.
