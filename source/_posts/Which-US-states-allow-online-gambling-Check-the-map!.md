#  Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey lead the way in online gambling

Some of the most developed online gambling jurisdictions in the world can be found in Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey. Credit for this goes to excellent regulatory frameworks and comprehensive licensing processes put in place by these states.

Due to the success of these states, other US states are looking to legalize some form of online gambling in order to boost their economies. This is a great move for both consumers and state governments as it will create more jobs and increase revenue without the need for tax increases.

The excitement over online gambling has even reached some countries outside of the US. For example, the United Kingdom is seeing a proliferation of new online bingo sites as that country continues to liberalize its gambling laws.

So what makes these states such great places for online gambling? Let’s take a look at each one in turn.

Nevada has been a hotspot for gambling since the early days of Las Vegas. It was only natural that this would extend to the internet once it became available. Nevada was one of the first states to legalize and regulate online poker in 2013, and it has been thriving ever since.

Delaware was another early adopter of online gambling, legalizing it in 2012. The state offers a wide variety of gaming options including casino games, poker and horseracing. Delaware also offers single-game sports betting, making it one of the most well-rounded online gambling jurisdictions in the world.

New Jersey took things one step further by legalizing all forms of online gambling in 2013. This includes casino games, poker, sports betting and horse racing. New Jersey quickly established itself as a leading jurisdiction thanks to its comprehensive licensing process and strict regulation framework.

#  Pennsylvania may be next to legalize online gambling

 Pennsylvania is the latest state considering legalizing and regulating online gambling. Lawmakers have been discussing the possibility for months, and a recent report from the state Senate suggests that a bill could come up for a vote as early as this fall.

If passed, Pennsylvania would join a small but growing list of states with online gambling laws. Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware have all legalized some form of online gambling, and several other states are currently considering similar measures.

Online gambling is broadly defined as any type of wagering that takes place over the internet. This can include casino games like blackjack and roulette, poker, and even sports betting.

Proponents of online gambling argue that it offers a number of benefits over traditional brick-and-mortar casinos. These include:

* Greater convenience – Players can access online casinos from anywhere in the world, provided they have an internet connection. This eliminates the need to travel to a physical casino location.

* More games – Online casinos typically offer more games than their physical counterparts. This includes both popular slot machine games and less common table games like baccarat and craps.

* Better odds – Online casinos often offer better odds than traditional casinos, making it more likely that players will win money.

* Lower costs – Online casinos typically do not charge entrance fees or minimum bets, which can make them cheaper to play at than traditional casinos.

Despite these advantages, there are some potential downsides to online gambling as well. These include:

* Addiction – There is a risk of developing an addiction to online gambling, which can lead to financial problems and other negative consequences.

* Fraud – There is also a risk of being scammed by fraudulent online casinos, which can result in theft of your money or personal information.

#  Atlantic City casinos getting into the online gambling game

Atlantic City casinos have long been havens for gambling enthusiasts, but now they are getting into the online gambling game. This is a move that could bolster their revenues at a time when brick-and-mortar casinos are dealing with competition from surrounding states.

The Borgata was the first Atlantic City casino to launch an online gambling site in 2013. Trump Taj Mahal, Tropicana Casino and Resort, Bally's Atlantic City, and Caesars Atlantic City followed suit. The Golden Nugget Atlantic City is the only casino in the city that does not offer online gambling.

Online gambling is especially popular among millennials, who make up a significant portion of the casino's customer base. In order to appeal to this demographic, the casinos have been rolling out new and innovative games.

Caesars Entertainment, which owns four of the city's eight casinos, has seen its online gaming revenue more than double since it launched its site in 2014. Overall, online gambling accounted for $209 million of the company's revenue in 2016, a 38 percent increase from the year before.

Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa also saw a jump in online revenue last year. The site brought in $149 million in 2016, compared with $118 million in 2015. That marked an increase of almost 27 percent.

While online gambling is bringing in more money for the casinos, it is also costing them jobs. The number of people employed in casino security and surveillance has dropped by about 25 percent since 2013 as players shift their attention to playing games on their phones and computers.
