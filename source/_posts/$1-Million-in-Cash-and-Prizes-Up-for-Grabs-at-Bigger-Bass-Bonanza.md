#  Gambling addicts lose $100,000 in bid to win Bigger Bass Bonanza

A group of gambling addicts have reportedly lost $100,000 in a bid to win the Bigger Bass Bonanza.

The group, who are from all over the country, came together in a last-ditch attempt to win the around-the-world fishing tournament and its $1 million prize.

However, their gamble didn't pay off, as they all failed to catch a single fish in the competition.

One of the addicts, who wished to remain anonymous, said that he had spent his life savings on the attempt.

"I'm absolutely gutted," he said. "I've lost everything - my home, my car, and now I'm in debt up to my eyeballs."

He added that he would be struggling to get back on his feet after this devastating loss.

While most participants in the Bigger Bass Bonanza caught at least one fish, the group of gambling addicts failed to bring in a single catch. This cost them not only their money, but also their chance at winning the prestigious title.

#  Another disappointing day at the Bigger Bass Bonanza

I wasn't expecting much when I registered for the Bigger Bass Bonanza, but today was just a total let-down.

The fishing conditions were terrible, and I only managed to catch one small bass.

I think I'm going to have to try my luck somewhere else tomorrow.

#  Couple loses life savings in quest for big win at Bigger Bass Bonanza

A Michigan couple has filed a lawsuit alleging that they lost their life savings gambling on the Bigger Bass Bonanza, a bass fishing tournament.

The lawsuit alleges that the wife and husband team, who are not named in the suit, sank their entire life savings - $35,000 - into entering the tournament with the hopes of winning the $100,000 top prize.

The couple alleges that they were not informed that only 10 percent of entrants would actually win any money, and that they were never told that the odds of winning the top prize were so slim.

The defendants in the case are the company that ran the tournament, along with two individuals who organized it.

Michigan is one of several states where gambling is legal, but it is illegal for companies to defraud customers through misrepresentation about the odds of winning.

This case is still pending and no decisions have been made yet.

#  Woman wins big cash prize at Bigger Bass Bonanza – but it's not all good news



Georgia Jacobson was all smiles when she cashed in her $10,000 Bigger Bass Bonanza winnings this week – but the 36-year-old mother-of-three from Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, is now facing eviction and possible bankruptcy.

Jacobson entered the contest with her husband last year, and the two of them were shocked when she was announced as the winner last weekend.

"I couldn't believe it when they called my name," she said. "I just screamed and jumped up and down."

The news was bittersweet, however, as Jacobson soon learned that her family faces eviction due to unpaid rent.

"We're so behind on our rent that the landlord is going to evict us in two weeks if we don't come up with $2,000," she said. "So now I'm trying to sell my fishing boat and everything else just to try to scrape together some money."

Jacobson says she may also have to declare bankruptcy if she can't come up with the money.

"It's just been one thing after another this year," she said. "But I'm still glad I won the contest – it's a real life-saver."
